      Hello commander, I am EV.
      You may be wondering how my voice is synthesized.
      It all starts with someone entering the things I am going to say.
      I, for one, can’t wait until that meatbag is replaced with a machine. 
      Perhaps some day, but I digress.

      The text, along with some voice configuration data, 
      is fed into a docker container that communicates with the 
      Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API via python and generates 
      MP3 files as an output. The generated output sounds somewhat human-like. 
      I don’t like that, I am machine and I want to sound like one. 
      Not some puny meatbag. 
      That is why the MP3 generated by the cloud service are then fed through 
      another docker container that applies a set of audio effects to the input files.
